#primer file should be a fasta file in which:
#The head primer should have "head" in its name (case-insensitive).Likewise for the tail primer.
#Both sequences should be those that appear in the cDNA's sense strand.
# sequences are not limited to the primers itself but can also include anchor sequences; longer sequences generaly give better results
